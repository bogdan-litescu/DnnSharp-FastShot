<h3>Just another DNN gallery module... a vintage one :).</h3>

Fast Shot is a simple DNN module for displaying images as galleries or slideshows. 
And it's free like freedom of speech, you can do anything with it

<h3>What does it means simple?</h3>

Well, when we designed Fast Shot we had to choose between packing many features into it 
and get a bloated monster that can’t carry its own weight or stick to just basic features. 
We chose simplicity but with limiting functionality.

<h3>Why is Fast Shot FREE?</h3>

There hasn't been much activity from our side on Fast Shot. In some ways the work for Fast Shot 
was superseded by the work on our popular DNN modules such as:
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/search-boost">Search Boost</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder">Action Form</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/my-custom-tokens">My Tokens</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/sharp-task-scheduler">Sharp Scheduler</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/seo-rewriter/url-adapter">URL Adapter</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/tabs-pro">Tabs Pro</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/workflow-segementation/redirect-toolkit">Redirect Toolkit</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/navxp-menus">NavXp</a>,
<a href="http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/easy-container">Easy Container</a>.

Although there are still quite a lot of downloads, which may mean that Fast Shot might be still competitive! 
In any case, we do not have the time to maintain and support Fast Shot anymore. 
So we were thinking of retiring it - making it officially inactive. 
But we changed our mind and Fast Shot is now open source and hosted here on GitHub.
This means you’ll have a collaborative codebase which gives you the ability to contribute to the source. Great, isn't it?!
